# Lab 3 
- Given the following C code file, perform a stack smash on the vuln.c code file
using a C program that you create named exploit.c. Your program should attempt to open up a
reverse shell on the attacked program as root by exploiting the buffer (you can verify this by typing
the command ‘whoami‘ on the resulting terminal). The vuln.c code must be compiled in its own,
separate program and must not be altered from its original state.
